MITgcm on vayu
==============

MITgcm is a numerical climate model developed for atmosphere and ocean
circulation research. MITgcm is not an ACCESS submodel, but it is a popular
ocean model among the CoE academic staff and CMS provides limited support for
running it on the NCI computers.

Acquring MITgcm
===============

The latest version of MITgcm is available from their public CVS repository. To
download the source code, type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    cvs -d :pserver:cvsanon@mitgcm.org:/u/gcmpack co -P MITgcm

This will place the code in a local folder named ``MITgcm``.

*The complete source requires about 300 MiB of storage, so you may want to keep
this in ``/short`` or a shared folder such as ``/projects``.*

Building MITgcm
===============

Once you have a copy of the MITgcm source code, you must build an executable.
A common method is to create a a directory (usually named ``mitgcm``) and two
subdirectories, one for the compiled code (``build``) and one for user-defined
source code (``code``). You will also need to acquire an "opt" file for vayu.

.. Include link to opt file (and how to manage it)

For example, type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    cd /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}
    mkdir mitgcm                    # Or any other directory
    cd mitgcm
    mkdir build
    mkdir code

The ``code`` folder contains any local code required for compilation, such as
``CPP_OPTIONS.h`` or ``SIZE.h``. The ``build`` folder contains the compiled
code and executable.

To build MITgcm, use the ``genmake2`` tool. If ``${CODEBASE}`` points to your
source code repository, then type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    cd build
    ${CODEBASE}/tools/genmake2 \
        -mods=../code \
        -rootdir=${MITgcm} \
        -of=../linux_ia64_ifort+mpi_vayu_anu
    make depend
    make -j 8
