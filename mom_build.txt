Acquiring and building MOM
==========================

Acquiring the source code
=========================

The MOM source code can either be downloaded directly from GFDL or through
local source code repositories at NCI. Due to licensing restrictions of other
software on the local repository, users must be granted permission to access
the local repositories. For access, contact climate_help@nf.nci.org.au.  

To acquire the latest version of the source code, type the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ mkdir -p /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models     # Or some other directory 
    $ cd /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models
    $ svn co https://access-svn.nci.org.au/svn/mom4/branches/local_changes mom4

where ``${PROJECT}`` is your default project group and ``${USER}`` is your
username. This will download the latest version of the source code into a
directory named ``mom4``.

Building MOM
============

Pre-configured scripts for compiling MOM on vayu are included in most of the
repositories. To use the scripts, type the following:

.. code:: bash

    # From the source code directory
    $ cd exp
    $ qsub mom4p1_solo_compile.csh

This will submit the ocean-only (or solo) version of MOM to the queueing
system. Compilation should require approximately 10 minutes, and will place an
executable in the following directory path:

.. code:: bash

    ${mom_svn}/exec_vayu/mom4p1_solo/fms_mom4p1_solo.x

where ``${mom_svn}`` is the path of the source code repository
(``/short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models/mom4`` in the previous example).

Several build scripts are included:

* ``mom4p1_solo_compile.csh``: Ocean-only MOM

* ``mom4p1_coupled_compile.csh``: MOM coupled to GFDL's atmosphere, land, and
  ice models

* ``mom4p1_ebm_compile.csh``: MOM coupled to an atmospheric energy-balanced
  model (EBM)

* ``CM2.1p1_compile.csh``: CM2.1-configured GFDL coupled climate model

To build these versions of MOM, submit them in the same manner as outlined
above. The executable paths resemble the ``mom4p1_solo`` builds (with slightly
different filenames).

Currently, only the solo and coupled scripts are configured for use on vayu.
Please contact CMS if there is interest in using the other versions.
