Acquiring and building MOM
==========================

Acquiring the source code
=========================

The MOM source code can either be downloaded directly from the main sourcecode
repository or through local repositories at NCI.

To acquire the CMS-supported version of the source code, type the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ mkdir -p /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models     # Or some other directory 
    $ cd /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models
    $ git clone git://github.com/coecms/mom.git

where ``${PROJECT}`` is your default project group and ``${USER}`` is your
username. This will download the latest version of the source code into a
directory named ``mom``.

Building MOM
============

A pre-configured script for compiling MOM on vayu are included in the CMS
github repository. To use the script, type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    # From the source code directory
    $ cd mom/exp
    $ qsub MOM_compile.csh

Compilation should require approximately 10 minutes, and will place an
executable in the following directory path:

.. code:: bash

    mom/exec/vayu/fms_MOM_SIS.x

relative to ``/short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/models`` if you followed the previous
instructions.

Versions of MOM
===============

The build script ``MOM_compile.chs`` has been pre-configured to build the
coupled ocean-ice version of MOM. The script can also be modified to build
other versions of MOM:

* ``MOM_solo``: Ocean-only MOM, without ice, land, or atmosphere

* ``MOM_SIS``: MOM coupled to the GFDL sea ice model (SIS)

* ``EBM``: Ocean / sea ice / land model coupled to an energy-balanced
  (radiation) atmosphere model (EBM)

* ``ICCM``: Ocean / sea ice / land / atmosphere

* ``CM2M``: CMIP-based ocean / sea ice / land / atmosphere

* ``ESM2M``: Coupled Earth System Model (biogeochemistry)
 
The script is pre-configured to build the ``MOM_SIS`` model. To build the other
versions, replace ``MOM_SIS`` in this line of ``MOM_compile.csh``:

.. code:: bash

    set type = MOM_SIS

with the version that you wish to build.

.. TODO: explain --type flag, reconcile with qsub's omission of flags
