Introduction to the NCI computing environment
=============================================

Creating an NCI account
=======================

Most CoE users should expect to run MOM on the NCI computers, such as vayu. To
request an account, visit the `New User Application`_ page at NCI.

Once your account has been created, you may need to connect your username to a
particular project. To do this, visit the `Project Connection Application`_
page at NCI.

You may need to contact your supervisor regarding the details of NCI access.

Acquiring a terminal emulator
=============================

Most interaction with the NCI computing environment is done through
command-line terminal emulators. On your computer, you will need to locate an
appropriate terminal application. For some recommendations:

* **OS X**: The default Terminal application is located in the
  ``/Applications/Utilities`` folder.

* **Windows**: PuTTY_ is a good standalone terminal application.

* **Linux**: The default terminal in most distributions should be sufficient.

For a more comprehensive list of terminals, consult the `Wikipedia Terminal
Emulator Comparison`_ page.

Logging on to vayu
==================

To log in using ``ssh`` (or secure shell), simply type the username followed by
vayu's domain address:

.. code:: bash

    $ ssh mxw157@vayu.nci.org.au

Remember to replace ``mxw157`` with your account username.

If you require window forwarding (such as for ``emacs`` or plotting software),
use the ``-Y`` flag:

.. code:: bash

    $ ssh -Y mxw157@vayu.nci.org.au

This flag enables encrypted window forwarding. If you are on a slow connection,
then you may want to replace ``-Y`` with ``-X`` for unencrypted window
forwarding.

To log out of vayu, type the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ exit      # or logout

Text Editors
============

Most users will need to modify various text files while logged in to the NCI
machines. For this reason, it is worthwhile to familiarise yourself with a text
editor. Some recommendations:

* ``pico`` is a simple text editor which behaves similarly to many
  graphical editors.

* ``vim`` is a powerful terminal editor, although it also has an intimidating
  learning curve. Typing ``vimtutor`` will open a beginner's tutorial.

* ``emacs`` is another powerful editor (and also a difficult learning curve)
  which includes a graphical user interface. You will need to log in using
  window forwarding (``-Y``).

To run each editor, type its name at the terminal command prompt, optionally
followed by a filename:

.. code:: bash

    $ vim my_file.txt
