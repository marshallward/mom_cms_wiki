Introduction to the NCI computing environment
=============================================

Creating an NCI account
=======================

Most CoE users should expect to run MOM on the NCI computers, such as vayu. To
request an account, visit the `New User Application`_ page at NCI.

Once your account has been created, you may need to connect your username to a
particular project. To do this, visit the `Project Connection Application`_
page at NCI.

You may need to contact your supervisor regarding the details of NCI access.

To verify access to vayu, open a terminal program and attempt an SSH
connection. (If you cannot locate a terminal program, quickly consult the next
section). If your username is ``mxw157``, then type the following:

.. code:: bash

    # Replace mxw157 with your username
    $ ssh mxw157@vayu.nci.org.au

If your password is correct and login is successful, then your account is ready
for use. To logout, type the following:

.. code:: bash

    $ exit

Working in the terminal shell
=============================

Most interaction with the NCI computing environment is done through
command-line terminal emulators. On your computer, you will need to locate an
appropriate terminal application. For some recommendations:

* **OS X**: The default Terminal application is located in the
  ``/Applications/Utilities`` folder.

* **Windows**: PuTTY_ is a good standalone terminal application.

* **Linux**: The default terminal in most distributions should be sufficient.

For a more comprehensive list of terminals, consult the `Wikipedia Terminal
Emulator Comparison`_ page.
