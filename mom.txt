MOM
===

MOM (Modular Ocean Model) is an ocean climate model developed at GFDL, and is
the ocean component of the ACCESS climate model system. The latest release of
MOM is version 4.1 (or MOM4p1).

Setting up the work environment
===============================

Creating an NCI account
-----------------------

Most CoE users should expect to run MOM on the NCI computers, such as vayu. To
request an account, visit the `New User Application`_ page at NCI.

Once your account has been created, you may need to connect your username to a
particular project. 

.. _New User Application:
    https://nf.nci.org.au/accounts/forms/user_registration.php

Working in the terminal shell
-----------------------------

Acquiring the source code
-------------------------

To acquire the latest version of the source code, create a directory in
``/short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/`` and type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    $ svn co https://access-svn.nci.org.au/svn/mom4/branches/local_changes mom4

Building MOM
------------

Pre-configured scripts for compiling MOM are included with most of the
repositories. To use the scripts, type the following:

.. code:: bash
    
    $ cd exp
    $ qsub mom4p1_solo_compile.csh

This will submit the ocean-only (or "solo") version of MOM to the queueing
system. Compilation should require approximately 10 minutes, and will place an
executable in the following directory path:

.. code:: bash
    
    /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/mom4/exec_vayu/mom4p1_solo/fms_mom4p1_solo.x

Several build scripts are included with the repository:

* ``mom4p1_solo_compile.csh``: Ocean-only MOM

* ``mom4p1_coupled_compile.csh``: MOM coupled to GFDL's atmosphere, land, and
  ice models

* ``mom4p1_ebm_compile.csh``: MOM coupled to an atmospheric energy-balanced
  model (EBM)

* ``CM2.1p1_compile.csh``: CM2.1-configured GFDL coupled climate model

To build these versions of MOM, submit them in the same manner as outlined
above.

Currently, only the solo and coupled scripts are configured for use on vayu.
Please contact CMS if there is interest in using the other versions.
