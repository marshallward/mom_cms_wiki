ACCESS-O (AusCOM)
=================
ACCESS-O (or AusCOM) is the ocean-ice implementation of the ACCESS climate
model. It consists of the ocean (MOM) and ice (CICE) components coupled through
OASIS and a data-driven atmospheric model (MATM), primarily driven by CORE
atmospheric forcing.

This document provides basic instructions for building and running standard
CORE-forced experiments.

*Note: These instructions assume that the user has access to the v45 project.
Contact CMS if you do not belong to this project.*


Installing AusCOM
=================
First locate an appropriate directory from where you can run AusCOM (usually
``/short``) and create a directory to hold your source code, e.g.:

.. code:: bash

   mkdir -p /short/v45/${USER}/projects     # Or any directory

where ``${USER}`` is your username.

*Note: Do not use ``/short/v45/${USER}/auscom``, since model output is stored
in this directory.*

Next, clone a copy of the repository:

.. code:: bash

   cd /short/v45/${USER}/projects
   git clone http://github.com/coecms/auscom.git

Once this complete, run the build script:

.. code:: bash

   cd auscom
   ./build_auscom.sh

A full build of all AusCOM components will usually take about an hour.

Once installation is complete, run the ``link_input.sh`` script to create
symbolic links to the input forcing fields:

.. code:: bash

   ./link_input.sh

The original copies of these files are stored in ``/g/data/v45/auscom``. If you
want to modify the forcing fields and configuration files, then you will need
to create new symbolic links to your own directories. *Contact CMS if you
require any assistance.*
   
You should now be ready to submit an AusCOM experiment.

However, if you ever need to delete the executables and rebuild AusCOM, there
is a script named ``clean_auscom.sh`` script which will delete any compiled
binaries:

.. code:: bash

   ./clean_auscom.sh


Running AusCOM
==============
The default experiment ``cnyf2-sw1`` is located with the repository. To run the
experiment, move to its directory and run the provided script:

.. code:: bash

   cd exp/cnyf2-sw1
   qsub run_auscom.sh

This will run for one model year, and will take approximately 3 hours.
