Configuring MOM4
================

This page outlines basic configuration of MOM4 experiments.

MOM4 Configuration Files
========================

MOM4 configuration is managed primarily through four text files:

* ``input.nml``: Principal configuration

* ``diag_table``: Diagnostic output management

* ``data_table``: Input and boundary condition data field management

* ``field_table``: Initial condition and advection scheme configuration

Basic Configuration
===================

Setting the simulation time
---------------------------

Simulation time (or integration time) is set in the ``input.nml`` namelist
file, in either ``ocean_solo_nml`` (for ocean-only runs) or ``coupler_nml``
(for coupled runs).

Ocean-only (solo) configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example ``ocean_solo_nml`` namelist record is shown below:

.. code:: fortran

     &ocean_solo_nml
        date_init = 1980,1,1,0,0,0
        calendar = 'julian'

        months  = 0
        days    = 2
        hours   = 0
        minutes = 0
        seconds = 0

        dt_cpld = 86400
    /

The major namelist fields are described below:

* ``date_init``: Simulation start time (if no ``ocean_solo.res`` timestamp is
  present, such as from a previous simulation, then this field is ignored)

* ``calendar``: Simulation calendar type. Four calendars are supported:

  * ``gregorian``: Modern calendar will full leap-year support

  * ``julian``: 365-day calendar with 4-year leap years

  * ``noleap``: 365-day calendar with no leap years

  * ``thirty_day``: 30-day months (or 360 days per year)

* ``months``, ``days``, etc.: Simulation (or integration) time

* ``dt_cpld``: Timestep (in seconds) to external data fields (usually
  atmospheric)

Coupled configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example ``coupler_nml`` record follows a similar structure:

.. code:: fortran

     &coupler_nml
        current_date = 1980,1,1,0,0,0
        calendar = 'noleap'
        months = 12

        do_atmos = .false.
        do_land  = .false.
        do_ice   = .true.
        do_ocean = .true.

        dt_cpld = 1800
        dt_atmos = 1800
    /

Many of the fields are identical to the ``ocean_solo_nml`` fields. The new or
modified fields are listed below:

* ``current_date``: Simulation start time, similar to ``date_init`` in
  ``ocean_solo_nml`` (in this case, the timestamp override file is named
  ``coupler.res``)

* ``do_atmos``, ``do_land``, etc.: Use to enable or disable submodel components

* ``dt_atmos``: Atmospheric model timestep (in seconds), including its coupling
  to land and ice (or the "fast" coupling timestep)

* ``dt_cpld``: Ocean-atmosphere coupling (or the "slow" coupling timestep).
  This must be a multiple of ``dt_atmos`` and ``dt_ocean``.

Timestep configuration
----------------------

The predominant numerical parameter in model configuration is timestep size.
MOM4 timestepping is configured in the ``ocean_model_nml`` namelist record. An
example record is provided below:

.. code:: fortran

     &ocean_model_nml
        dt_ocean = 10800
        vertical_coordinate = 'zstar'
        barotropic_split = 60
    /

Some typical timestep settings are as follows:

* ``dt_ocean``: Ocean model timestep size (in seconds)

* ``vertical_coordinate``: Vertical coordinate type, the most common options
  are listed below:

  * ``geopotential``: Geopotential (equivalent to depth in many cases)

  * ``zstar``: Quasi-horizontal depth

  * ``pressure``: Pressure-based vertical coordiante

  * ``pstar``: Quasi-horizontal pressure

* ``barotropic_split``: Split timestepping between the ocean free surface (or
  barotropic) and internal (or baroclinic) flow. A barotropic timestep of 60
  means that there are sixty free surface timesteps per model timesteps (set by
  ``dt_ocean``).

Advanced Configuration
======================

A typical ``input.nml`` file will usually contain a large number of namelist
records, sometimes as many as 100 for fully coupled models. Much of the
configuration settings are determined through experiment design, which is a
nontrivial task and often a subject of ongoing research.

data_table
----------

The ``data_table`` file is used to supply a MOM experiment with external data
forcing fields, such as surface winds or radiative heating.

Example ``data_table`` record:

.. code:: fortran

    "OCN", "u_flux", "taux", "INPUT/stress.nc", .true., 1.0

* ``"OCN"``: Identifies the class of the field. It contains one of the
  following values: ``ATM``, ``OCN``, ``LND``, ``ICE``

* ``"u_flux"``: The field variable name as defined in MOM4.

* ``"taux"``: The field variable name as defined in the netCDF provided by the
  user.

* ``"INPUT/stress.nc"``: The path (including filename) for the netCDF file
  containing the forcing field. Local paths can be used.

* ``.true.``: Indicates whether or not the field is on the the ocean model
  grid. A value of ``.false.`` indicates that it does not match the model grid
  and requires interpolation (as computed by MOM).

* ``1.0``: A rescaling factor applied to the field. A value of ``1.0``
  indicates no rescaling, while a value of ``0.`` will set all values to zero.
