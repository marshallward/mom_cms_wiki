Running MOM experiments
=======================

Running an ocean simulation using MOM requires three steps:

1. Designing an experiment, including its numerical grids and forcing fields

2. Configuring MOM's numerical settings and physical parameterisations

3. Executing MOM and generating numerical output

This section focusses on the final step of model execution, as well as a
cursory discussion of model configuration. It assumes that you have been
provided with a pre-configured experiment, such as one of the MOM4 examples.

In general, model design and configuration is a complex process which can
require a broad range of expertise. For more detailed discussions about
experiment design, consult the MOM4 documentation and ocean modelling
literature.

Running MOM
===========

Before beginning, make sure that you have an experiment ready for MOM
simulation, as well as a compiled MOM4 executable.

This page outlines two methods for running MOM4:

* Sample scripts provided by GFDL

* Running MOM4 from the terminal shell

Sample experiments
------------------

GFDL provides pre-configured scripts and experiments for testing purposes. Two
sample experiments are included in the repository:

* ``torus1``: Tracer advection test

* ``box_channel1``: Idealised thermohaline sector

The configuration files for each experiment are located in the ``work``
subdirectory, but GFDL provides scripts to run these experiments that are kept
in the ``expt`` subdirectory. To run a particular experiment, modify the
following line in the ``mom4p1_solo_run.csh``:

.. code:: bash

    set name = torus1

Replace ``torus1`` with the experiment in ``work`` that you wish to run.

Once the script is ready, submit it to the job queue:

.. code:: bash

    qsub mom4p1_solo_run.csh

When complete, the model output, along with a compressed tarball, will be
stored in the following directories:

.. code:: bash

    /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/mom4/work/${expt}
    /short/${PROJECT}/${USER}/mom4/archive/mom4p1_solo/${expt}.output.tar.gz

where ``${expt}`` is the name of your experiment (e.g. ``torus1``).

If you wish to run a pre-configured MOM experiment using these scripts, then
you can create a new directory in the ``work`` directory and point the script
to this directory.

Running MOM at command line
---------------------------

To create a custom experiment, one must first generate appropriate grid and
configuration files, as well as any necessary data fields for forcing and
initial conditions. Once the experiment has been created, the files must be
placed in the appropriate directories, and the model is executed within the
directory.

Example directory paths for the configuration files, data fields, model
executable, and experiment are listed below:

.. code:: bash

    $ short=/short/${PROJECT}/${USER}
    $ expt=${short}/mom4/sample_expt
    $ config=${HOME}/mom4/sample_config
    $ data=${short}/sample_data
    $ exec=${short}/models/mom4/exec_vayu/mom4p1_solo/fms_mom4p1_solo.x

Your own paths will vary; substitute your own paths in the commands listed
below.

Assuming the pathnames above, submit the following commands to run MOM:

.. code:: bash

    # Create a directory to run your experiment
    $ mkdir -p ${expt}

    # Create INPUT and RESTART subdirectories
    $ mkdir -p ${expt}/INPUT
    $ mkdir -p ${expt}/RESTART

    # Copy configuration files to the experiment directory:
    $ cp ${config}/input.nml ${expt}
    $ cp ${config}/diag_table ${expt}
    $ cp ${config}/data_table ${expt}
    $ cp ${config}/field_table ${expt}

    # Finally, copy any data fields (forcings or initial fields) to INPUT:
    $ cp ${data}/* ${expt}/INPUT

If your forcing files are large, you may want to use symbolic links instead of
file copies:

.. code:: bash

    $ ln -s ${data}/* ${expt}/INPUT

Once the experiment is ready for MOM, run the experiment with the executable:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd ${expt}
    $ ./${exec}

As with most computational jobs on vayu, consider submitting your runs through
the (PBS) job submission system. An example script (e.g. ``sample_run.sh``):

.. code:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    #PBS -q normal
    #PBS -l walltime=1:00:00
    #PBS -l vmem=4GB
    #PBS -l ncpus=8
    #PBS -N sample_expt
    #PBS -joe
    #PBS -wd
    
    ./${exec} 

Submit your script in the usual manner:

.. code:: bash

    cd ${expt}
    qsub sample_run.sh

If the model runs without any errors, then output will appear in the same
experiment directory ``${expt}``.

payu: Python-based workflow scripts
-----------------------------------

Payu consists of a collection of python scripts used to manage several ocean
model simulations, such as MOM4. Their use will be outlined in a separate
section.
