====

Payu is a collection of python-based workflow scripts for ocean model
simulations on the vayu computer cluster. The scripts provide a common
framework for running several different ocean models, as well as a consistent
directory structure for the model configuration and output.

The following models are currently supported by payu:

* MOM4: GFDL ocean climate model used in several CMIP studies

* GOLD: GFDL isopycnal ocean model (under development)

* MITgcm: Finite-volume ocean model supporting nonhydrostatic dynamics
