MOM output diagnostics
======================

MOM output is managed through the FMS diagnostics manager, and configured
using the ``diag_table`` file. This page describes the format of ``diag_table``
records and how to manage output diagnostic in MOM.

diag_table
==========

``diag_table`` configuration files contain two types of records:

* Files: NetCDF output files containing MOM4 output

* Fields: Individual data fields (such as velocity or temperature) to be saved.

Output file specification
-------------------------

``diag_table`` files begin with output file records. An example output file is
shown below:

.. code:: fortran

    "ocean_snap", 5, "days", 1, "days", "Time"

Each field is discussed below (in order of appearance)

* ``"ocean_snap"``: The filename of a target netCDF output file. A ``.nc``
  extension will be appended to the filename.

* ``5, "days"``: The output frequency for variables in this file, followed by
  units. Standard calendar units can be used (days, hours, etc.).

* ``1, "days"``: Output time axis unit of measurement (with units).

* ``"Time"``: Time axis variable name in the netCDF file.

Output frequency and other time-related information is associated with
individual files. For this reason, variables with similar output rates should
generally be grouped together in the same file.

Field specification
-------------------

Example field record:

.. code:: fortran

    "ocean_model", "u", "u", "ocean_snap", "all", .false., "none", 2

* ``"ocean_model"``: MOM4 module containing the diagnostic variable. This is
  typically attributed to a particular submodel, such as ``"ocean_model"`` or
  ``"ice_model"``.

* ``"u", "u"``: The MOM4 registered variable name, and the output netCDF
  variable name, respectively. The first must match the variable name in the
  MOM4 source code, but the second can be renamed by the user.

* ``"ocean_snap"``: The output file (defined in the ``diag_table`` file record)
  which will store this variable.

* ``"all"``: The sampling rate of the variable. ``"all"`` means that the
  variable is sampled for every value on the time axis (as specified in the
  file record).

* ``.false.``: Time averaging between output times. ``.true.`` saves the
  time-averaged values between time sampling rates, while ``.false.`` returns
  snapshots of the fields at each point on the time axis.

* ``"none"``: Optional arguments, usually defined in MOM4. ``"none"`` denotes
  no optional arguments.

* ``2``: Output data type. Four formats are supported:

  * ``1``: Double-precision (64-bit) floating point

  * ``2``: Single-precision (32-bit) floating point

  * ``4``: 16-bit integer packed variables (typically used for long-term
    archival)

  * ``8``: 8-bit integer-packed variables (untested)

Creating new variables
======================

To create new variables for output not included in the default version requires
a modification of the MOM4 source code.
